<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>So you've been told that you have to deliver Digital Technologies. </p>
<p>We often forget our students don't even have to touch anything digital, beeping, glowing, or electronic to learn digital technologies.</p>
<p>For my first magic trick today, I'm going to give <strong>two ideas for every DigiTech band, from Foundation to Year 10</strong>.</p>
<p>And just to make it more interesting, I'll do it blindfolded, with two hands tied behind my back, and <strong>for each band, I'll give an idea that doesn't use anything techy</strong>. That means something you can do with <strong>🚫no iPad</strong>, <strong>🚫nothing that beeps or lights up</strong>, and <strong>🚫 no gosh-darn fancy-pants electricity</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>

<h3 id="with-tech-beebots">💻 With tech: BeeBots 🐝</h3>

</video>

<p><strong>Using:</strong> BeeBots (about $120, can be used in small groups)</p>
<p>The beauty of BeeBots is that they do almost nothing at all.</p>
<p>If you've ever tried to get a classroom full of 5-year-olds to follow a series of instructions on an iPad, you'll know how painful it can be to keep them engaged in a world of possibility.</p>
<p>BeeBots are bright yellow robots, specifically designed for young little kidlets. Almost indestructible, they only have 7 buttons on them so that students can program very simple instructions for their bee.</p>

<h3 id="without-tech-reduce-reuse-recycle">📝 Without tech: Reduce, reuse, recycle</h3>
<p>Let's be real: 1-1 devices cost a bloody fortune. Even if your school can afford to have iPad for each student, failures are inevitable (just like in learning!).</p>
<p>The easiest way to do Digital Technologies without tech, is to realise that <em>you are already doing Digital Technologies</em>.</p>
<p>🐻 Bear with me for a minute, and check out these content descriptions.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td width=50%>
"Collect, explore and sort data, and use digital systems to present the data creatively" (ACTDIP003)
</td>
<td width=50%>
"Sort and classify familiar objects and explain the basis for these classifications. Copy, continue and create patterns with objects and drawings" (ACMNA005)
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Wanna know a secret? The one on the left is from Digital Technologies, and the one on the right is from Mathematics. They're not the same, but they're pretty darn close. There are a few of these hidden throughout the <s>National Curriculum</s>, <s>ACARA</s> Australian Curriculum, like super-secret Easter eggs. Watch out for the same things in other learning areas.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That's why it's important to check the DigiTech curriculum to see what you've covered, and then just plug in the gaps.</p>
<h2 id="years-3-and-4">Years 3 and 4</h2>
<h3 id="with-tech-lego-mindstorms">💻 With tech: LEGO Mindstorms 🤖</h3>
<p><strong>Using:</strong> LEGO Mindstorms EV3 (about $390 per kit, can be used in very small groups), typically with an iPad</p>
<video autoplay muted loop style="width:40%;padding:0px 10px; float:right">
  <source src="https://blog.classgen.com/images/ev3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>I love that before students start to program their robots with EV3, they need to build them.</p>
<p>This means that even before you grab the batteries or charge the thing up, students are already:</p>
<ul>
<li>learning how to follow written visual instructions</li>
<li>collaborating via the "why doesn't mine look like yours?", and "how did you do this bit?"</li>
<li>problem-solving issues along the way, and building resilience in the process</li>
</ul>
<p>In the programming itself, I've seen the LEGO EV3 robots used with Year 3, 4, 10 and even <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/006263/1/sem-2">university-level students</a>. There is a lot of scope to go up or down.</p>
<h3 id="without-tech-unplugged">📝 Without tech: Unplugged 🔌</h3>
<p>We're getting into CS Unplugged territory here -- a great resource!</p>
<p>CS Unplugged have loads of resources for this age group, like the <a href="https://csunplugged.org/en/topics/kidbots/">kidbots unit plan</a>. This is probably my favourite technique to teach computer science: get students to plan out an algorithm, then physically walk out that algorithm. You can also get the kids to give instructions for you, which makes for <a href="https://youtu.be/cDA3_5982h8">a very entertaining lesson</a></p>
<h2 id="years-5-and-6">Years 5 and 6</h2>
<h3 id="with-tech-scratch">💻 With tech: Scratch 😸</h3>
<p>I have so much respect for the impact that Scratch has had on CS education. Even though I love programming, I know that written code is a major turn-off for young coders. It's confusing and fussy and blegh.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are ⛵-loads of resources around the place. Are you the kind of teacher that wants a structured eBook to get started? Then check out the <a href="http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/files/CreativeComputing20141015.pdf">Creative Computing eBook</a>, which has tonnes of ideas and resources to structure a Scratch unit.</p>

<h3 id="without-tech-binary-numbers">📝 Without tech: Binary numbers</h3>
<p>CS Unplugged saves the day again! (Okay, okay! I promise this is the last time!)</p>
<p>The beauty about their classic <a href="https://classic.csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-01-binary_numbers.pdf">binary numbers</a> lesson plan is that it is just so versatile. I've used it with Year 11 students and we had a boatload of fun. Well, I had fun, and that's what counts, right? 🤷</p>
<h2 id="years-7-and-8">Years 7 and 8</h2>
<h3 id="with-tech-bbc-microbit-30-each">💻 With tech: BBC Microbit ($30 each)</h3>
<video autoplay muted loop style="width:40%;padding:0px 10px; float:right">
  <source src="https://blog.classgen.com/images/bbc_microbit.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p><a href="http://microbit.org/">BBC Microbit</a> combines the drag-and-drop ease-of-use of Scratch with a microcontroller (tiny computer) that is packed with sensors. It's got 💡light, 🌏compass and 🌡temperature sensors, and has 🎮buttons, a 📺screen and heaps of cool other stuff.</p>
<p>It is so easy to set up and use compared to an Arduino. I love Arduino to bits as a programmer, but you can tear your hair out trying to troubleshoot an entire screaming classroom of wires-in-the-wrong-places and struggle to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Get the kids comfy with a Microbit first, then bust out the Arduino for the cluey coders in your class.</p>
<h3 id="without-tech-group-chat">📝 Without tech: Group chat 💬</h3>
<p>Acquire data from a range of sources and evaluate authenticity, accuracy and timeliness (ACTDIP025)</p>
<p>We know that modern tech brings advantages, but it also brings a huge variety of social issues. What better way to combat this, than with open group discussions with your students?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/education-resources/classroom-resources">eSafety</a> website is funded by the Aussie government, and has tonnes of resources to help you out. In Year 7/8, there are lesson plans and worksheets for <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/-/media/cesc/documents/standalone-lesson-plans/lesson-plan-doc-lower-secondary-digital-citizenship.doc">digital citizenship</a> <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/-/media/cesc/documents/standalone-lesson-plans/lesson-plan-doc-lower-secondary-sexting.doc">sexting</a> and <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/-/media/cesc/documents/standalone-lesson-plans/lesson-plan-doc-lower-secondary-cyberbullying.doc">cyberbullying</a>. All of these can be done even without a projector or IWB! While the worksheets are great, they also make a great stimulus for a class chat.</p>
<p>My Year 8 students reacted really well to the <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/education-resources/classroom-resources/tagged">Tagged</a> eSafety unit. I think they even surprised themselves with a maturity that they never knew they had!</p>
<p>Remember to use <a href="/images/groupnorms.png">group norms</a>, like in the <a href="http://www.stg.catholic.edu.au/__files/f/5344/Keeping_Safe_CALD-2b8o5j0.pdf">Child Protection Curriculum</a> (page 11).</p>
<h2 id="years-9-and-10">Years 9 and 10</h2>
<h3 id="with-tech-grok-learning-ncss-challenge-20-per-year-per-student-or-30-per-student-for-all-access">💻 With tech: <a href="https://groklearning.com">Grok Learning NCSS Challenge</a> ($20 per year, per student, or $30 per student for all-access)</h3>
<p>The Grok Learning NCSS challenge is amazing 😍. I've used it with Year 9 to 12 students, and every single time it is an absolute godsend 😇🙏🙌.</p>
<p>What I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has enough scaffolding to support the challenges.</li>
<li>It doesn't go all helicopter-mum and stop them making mistakes. Instead, it guides students back to the solution when they inevitably make an error.</li>
<li>You can display the leaderboard during your lesson if you want to, and this competitive streak is great for both ends of the class. I know there are loads of counterarguments against leaderboards, but I've found that students at the bottom get a major wriggle-on when they actually realise that they need to put in the hard yards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="without-tech-planning-computer-programs">📝 Without tech: Planning computer programs 🤔</h3>
<p><img src="images/ux-sketching-7-e1513571125563.jpg" style="width:30%; float:right"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Plan and manage projects using an iterative and collaborative approach, identifying risks and considering safety and sustainability (ACTDIP044)</li>
<li>Design algorithms represented diagrammatically and in structured English and validate algorithms and programs through tracing and test cases (ACTDIP040)</li>
</ul>
<p>Students can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a flowchart that a computer could use to solve a problem. There are heaps of <a href="https://www.edrawsoft.com/flowchart-examples-for-students.php">examples of flowcharts that you can show to students</a>, which I've found is the best way to demonstrate the ♢&nbsp;diamonds for decisions and the ▭&nbsp;rectangles for actions.</li>
<li>Break a larger project down into small tasks, and assign each task to individual team members. They can estimate timeframes using a <a href="https://www.projectmanager.com/gantt-chart">Gantt chart</a> on paper.</li>
<li>Draw sketches of what their program/game/project/website will look like.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://digitaltechnologieshub.edu.au">Digital Technologies Hub</a> has units, lesson plans, and links to heaps of resources.
The <a href="https://csermoocs.appspot.com">Computer Science MOOC</a> from the University of Adelaide is a great PD that runs through more options for your year level.</p>
